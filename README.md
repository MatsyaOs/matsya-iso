# Matsya-iso
 iso builds of MatsyaOs
Description
===========


Archuseriso is a set of script programs written in Bash based on Archiso, the Arch Linux tool for building the official iso image released monthly.

Archuseriso aims at extending the base features of Archiso, providing pre-configured build profiles for building live iso images with desktop environment.

Archuseriso brings additional tools for making a bootable live usb drive with persistence, allowing to run Arch Linux on a removable medium for many kinds of use cases.

Alternatively a standard installation can be performed if persistence is not an option for your needs.

Another cool feature of Archuseriso is optional disk encryption.

Installation
------------

Installation from the AUR [archuseriso](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archuseriso/)

Installation from the git repository:

Note that Archuseriso was designed for Arch Linux and was not tested on Arch Linux derivatives.

Build iso image
---------------

Synopsis:

    aui-mkiso [options] <path to profile>

Build Xfce iso image with default options:


Default build directory `/usr/share/archuseriso/profiles` assumed when path to profile not provided:

    sudo aui-mkiso matsya




#### Btrfs file system

For the Btrfs file system two subvolumes are created: `rootfs` and `home`. The `rootfs` subvolume for root persistence and the `home` subvolume for home persistence.


#### ZFS support

Run `aui-build_zfs_packages` for building the ZFS package.

Standard installation on usb drive
----------------------------------
A standard installation on a usb drive can be performed. The live settings are removed except systemd journal that remains configured in volatile mode to limit disk I/O.

Synopsis:

    aui-mkinstall [options] <iso image> <usb device>

Example:

    sudo aui-mkinstall aui-xfce-linux_5_7_10-0724-x64.iso /dev/sdc

The drive partitioning is as follow:

    GPT layout
    Partition   FS Type           Type
    #1          EFI FAT           Boot
    #2          Ext4|Btrfs|F2FS   System

Make hybrid usb drive
---------------------
Combines both a live system and a standard installation. The boot menu offers to boot live or to boot the system installed on the usb drive.

Synopsis:

    aui-mkhybrid [options] <iso image> <usb device>

Example:

    sudo aui-mkhybrid aui-xfce-linux_5_10_9-0121-x64.iso /dev/sdc


The drive partitioning is as follow:

    GPT layout
    Partition   FS Type           Type
    #1          Ext4              Squashfs image
    #2          EFI FAT           Boot
    #3          Ext4|Brtfs|F2FS   System

Test the iso image and the usb drive
------------------------------------
Run `aui-run` to test the iso image or the usb drive in a qemu virtual machine.

Examples:

iso image test in bios mode

    aui-run -i aui-xfce-linux_5_10_7-0116-x64.iso

iso image test in uefi mode

    aui-run -u -i aui-xfce-linux_5_10_7-0116-x64.iso

usb drive /dev/sdc test in bios mode

    sudo aui-run -d /dev/sdc

usb drive /dev/sdc test in uefi mode

    sudo aui-run -u -d /dev/sdc
